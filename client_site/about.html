        <p>
            At 401 Thrift, we believe that fashion should be sustainable, affordable, and unique. Our mission is 
            to provide access to high-quality vintage and secondhand clothing while reducing fashion waste and 
            promoting conscious consumption. Every item in our collection has a story, and we're passionate about 
            helping these pieces find their next chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
            We carefully curate each item, ensuring that only the best vintage finds make it to our shop. From 
            retro band tees to classic denim jackets, vintage sneakers to timeless accessories, we hunt for pieces 
            that combine style, quality, and character. Our goal is simple: make sustainable fashion accessible 
            and exciting for everyone.
        </p>

        <!-- Our Story Section -->
        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
            401 Thrift started as a passion project born from countless hours spent exploring thrift stores, vintage 
            shops, and estate sales. What began as a personal hobby quickly turned into something bigger when friends 
            and family kept asking where to find unique pieces like the ones we were discovering.
        </p>

        <img src="images/about-story.jpg" alt="Vintage thrift store finds" class="content-image">

        <p>
            We realized there was a gap in the market: people wanted access to curated vintage finds without spending 
            hours digging through crowded thrift stores. They wanted the thrill of discovery with the convenience of 
            online shopping. That's when 401 Thrift was born. We do the hunting so you don't have to, bringing the 
            best thrift finds directly to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we're proud to serve a growing community of vintage enthusiasts, sustainable fashion advocates, 
            and anyone looking for unique pieces that stand out from fast fashion. Every item we post has been 
            hand-selected with care, and we love seeing our finds get a second life with amazing people like you.
        </p>

        <!-- Why Shop Vintage Section -->
        <h2>Why Shop Vintage?</h2>

        <p>
            Shopping vintage and secondhand isn't just about style—it's about making a positive impact. The fashion 
            industry is one of the largest polluters globally, and fast fashion contributes to massive waste. By 
            choosing vintage, you're reducing demand for new production, keeping quality items out of landfills, 
            and celebrating craftsmanship that stands the test of time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plus, vintage fashion offers something that new clothing simply can't: uniqueness. When you wear vintage, 
            you're wearing pieces that aren't mass-produced. You're less likely to run into someone wearing the same 
            thing, and you're expressing a style that's truly your own. Whether you're drawn to 90s grunge, 80s 
            athletic wear, or classic denim, vintage has something for every aesthetic.
        </p>
